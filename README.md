# Self-Building-Customer-Service-TTS-STT-
The project aims to build a Customer Service Builder that relies on voice interaction instead of text only, allowing the customer to speak directly with the system, while the system responds with a natural-sounding voice through the integration of Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS).
